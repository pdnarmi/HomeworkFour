# HomeworkFour


This is the website I built designed to test a user's knowledge of javascript.

The quiz is timed and wrong answers penalize your time and score, while correct
answers improve score and add more time. The game concludes when the user has
reached the end of the quiz and submitted their score or the timer reaches zero.

They are then prompted to enter their initials and a button to submit them, along
with their score into their browser's local storage. They are then displayed on
the highscores page, with the most recent score being displayed at the top!
